# Deployment

This project was built using Gitpod and deployed using Heroku.

Deployment to heroku was done by first making a Heroku app chosing the name then selecting the region. Second I made a requirements.txt file so Heroku could understand what is
needed to be installed to run my app. Then I created a Procfile to tell Heroku what kind of application is being deployed and what build pack is required to run it. The deploy 
method used is a straight connection to git hub, this was achieved by going to the deploy tab when logged into heroku, then going to deployment method and connecting to my github 
account. Next was to link the github repository I wanted to connect this was done by searching for the repository I wanted to connect, ie Top_Football and clicking connect. During
the build at different points I added my key to the config vars in heroku app, ie aws, database, stripe and email.
After that set up automatic deploys this was done by selecting the branch, ie the master. AWS set for deployment as well hosting all my media and static files, that was done following
the gudie from the course content.
